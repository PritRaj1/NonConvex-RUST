# Stochastic Gradient Ascent

Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA) is a gradient-based optimization algorithm. It is a simple and efficient optimization algorithm that is often used in machine learning and deep learning applications.

## Config example

Fully-defined:

```json
{
    "alg_conf": {
        "SGA": {
            "learning_rate": 0.1,
            "momentum": 0.9
        }
    }
}

Default values, (nothing needs to be specified):

```json
{
    "alg_conf": {
        "SGA": {}
    }
}
```
