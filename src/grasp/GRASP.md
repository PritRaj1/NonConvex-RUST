# Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures

GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures) is a multi-start metaheuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems.

## Construction Phase

The construction phase is the first step of the GRASP algorithm. It is used to generate a feasible solution. The algorithm starts with an empty solution and iteratively adds elements to the solution until a feasible solution is found.

## Local Search Phase

The local search phase is the second step of the GRASP algorithm. It is used to improve the solution generated in the construction phase. The algorithm starts with the solution generated in the construction phase and iteratively improves the solution until a local optimum is found.
